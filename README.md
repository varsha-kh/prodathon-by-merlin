# Hackaton Problem Statement
With a solid installation rate, there are a lot of rapid uninstallation rates.
 For every 10 installs consider 5 uninstalls that happen at T+2 to T+7 day
 post installation for one cohort. 
As a PM at Merlin, your first task would be to do some research and get
 the industry standard uninstallation rate for a Chrome extension. Then
 figure out a way to beat this score. Draw up a plan to reduce it while
 keeping in mind we don't want any compromise on our revenue initiatives
